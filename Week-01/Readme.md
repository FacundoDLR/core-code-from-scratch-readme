# Algorithms - Week 1

## (Wednesday) 💻

## 1. Pizza Recipe

### Description

Design an algorithm to prepare a pizza from scratch. Define the ingredients, what will be the flavor and the preparation.
### Solution

1. Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C).
2. Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface and transfer it to a baking sheet.
3. Spread tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a 1-inch (2.5 cm) border around the edges.
4. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
5. Add your desired toppings, such as sliced mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, and pepperoni.
6. Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
7. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.

## 2. Hot N Cold 🤒 🧊 🔥

### Description
Define an algorithm that is able to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

### Solution
To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit:

1. Take the Celsius temperature as input.
2. Multiply the Celsius temperature by 1.8.
3. Add 32 to the result of step 2.
4. The resulting value is the Fahrenheit temperature.
---
To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius:

1. Take the Fahrenheit temperature as input.
2. Subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature.
3. Divide the result of step 2 by 1.8.
4. The resulting value is the Celsius temperature.

## 3. Some geometry 📐
### Description
Design an algorithm to calculate the volume of a pyramid, a cube and a sphere.

### Solution

To calculate the volume of a pyramid:

1. Take the base length, base width, and height of the pyramid as inputs.
2. Multiply the base length by the base width to get the area of the base.
3. Multiply the area of the base by the height of the pyramid.
4. Divide the result of step 3 by 3.
5. The resulting value is the volume of the pyramid.
---

To calculate the volume of a cube:

1. Take the length of one side of the cube as input.
2. Cube the length of one side.
3. The resulting value is the volume of the cube.
---

To calculate the volume of a sphere:

1. Take the radius of the sphere as input.
2. Cube the radius.
3. Multiply the result of step 2 by 4/3 and by pi (3.14159).
4. The resulting value is the volume of the sphere.
