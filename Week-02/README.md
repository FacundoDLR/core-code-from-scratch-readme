# Pseudocode - Week 2
## (Monday) 游눹

## 1. Logic problem
### Description
The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

- Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
- Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
- Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
- Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
- Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

### Expected output
Identify which student is telling the truth

### Solution 游땙

The problem is to determine which of the five students is telling the truth. If we assume that one person is telling the truth, then we must analyze each statement to see if it is possible for that person to be the only one telling the truth.

- Alice states that nobody studied math yesterday, but this is not possible because it contradicts the statements of Bob, Charlie, Dan, and Eva.

- Bob says that one person studied math yesterday. If we accept that Bob is telling the truth, then he is the only person who studied math yesterday.

- Charlie states that two people studied math yesterday, but this contradicts Bob's statement. Therefore, if we accept that Bob is telling the truth, then Charlie is lying.

- Dan says that three people studied math yesterday, but this also contradicts Bob's statement. Therefore, if we accept that Bob is telling the truth, then Dan is also lying.

- Eva states that four people studied math yesterday. If we accept that Bob is telling the truth, then we must also accept that Eva is telling the truth, which means that four people studied math yesterday.

Therefore, the only possibility that remains is that Bob and three other people studied math yesterday, and the only person who is telling the truth is **Eva**.

## 2. Which comes first, cereal or milk?

### Description
Create an algorithm to prepare a bowl of cereal with milk. Represent the result in pseudocode and in a flowchart.

### Expected output
Two ways to represent your algorithm previously created

### Solution 游땙

1. Get a bowl
2. Add cereal to the bowl
3. Get milk from the refrigerator
4. Pour milk into the bowl of cereal
5. Enjoy!

Here is the flowchart representation of the algorithm:

## (Tuesday) 游눹

## 1. Print my name & age
### Description
This challenge is similar to the previous guided challenge, but now you will try alone. For this challenge, you will need to create an algorithm in Pseudocode using PSeInt that prints your name and your age in separate lines, remeber that your name should be a string and your age a number

### Solution 游땙
```PSeInt
Algoritmo myNameAndAge
	escribir 'Facundo Andres de los Rios'
	escribir '26'
FinAlgoritmo
```

## (Wednesday) 游눹

## 1. Algorithm game

### Description
This will be a fun challenge, you will be playing a game base on simple commands, and the idea is for you to help the squirrel to take the pine cone. For this challenge try to pass the first 15 levels. We wish you all the luck and happy gaming.

P.S. If you like, you can try to do all 27 levels, but following level 15 we will need more programming concepts, maybe you can go back to this challenge later 游땔

## 2. Mod

### Description. Mod in PSeInt Challenge
The challenge for you now is to create a PSeInt program that will receive a number from the user and add the mod operator using the even/odd case ( X % 2 ) where X is the user input

### Solution 游땙
```PSeInt
Algoritmo ModuloParImpar
    // Solicitamos un n칰mero al usuario
    Escribir "Ingrese un n칰mero:"
    Leer num

    // Calculamos el m칩dulo 2 del n칰mero ingresado
    resto = num % 2

    // Verificamos si el n칰mero es par o impar
    Si resto == 0 Entonces
        Escribir "El n칰mero ingresado es par."
    SiNo
        Escribir "El n칰mero ingresado es impar."
    FinSi

FinAlgoritmo
```

## 3. Register form

### Description
You are given the task to create a registration form for new users, this form should ask the user for the following information:

First name
Last name
Age
Email
Address
At the end of the program, you should print all the information added from the user in a friendly way

### Solution 游땙

```PSeInt
Algoritmo RegistroDeUsuarios
    // Solicitamos al usuario que ingrese su informaci칩n
    Escribir "Bienvenido al formulario de registro de usuarios"
    Escribir "Por favor ingrese su informaci칩n personal:"
    Escribir " "
	
    Escribir "Nombre:"
    Leer nombre
	
    Escribir "Apellido:"
    Leer apellido
	
    Escribir "Edad:"
    Leer edad
	
    Escribir "Email:"
    Leer email
	
    Escribir "Direcci칩n:"
    Leer direccion
	
    // Imprimimos la informaci칩n ingresada por el usuario
    Escribir " "
    Escribir "Gracias por registrarse! Aqu칤 est치 su informaci칩n personal:"
    Escribir "Nombre completo: " + nombre + " " + apellido
    Escribir "Edad: " + edad
    Escribir "Email: " + email
    Escribir "Direcci칩n: " + direccion
	
FinAlgoritmo
```
